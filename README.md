        <h2>Entry 1: The arrive</h2>
        <p>A few years, I finally arrived at Disney World Orlando, I was so excited as I arrived the hotel. The weather was perfect, and I could already feel the magic in the air.</p>
        <p>I checked the hotel, (because it was like a little park) and couldn't wait to explore the parks the next day</p>

    <section id="entry2">
        <h2>Entry 2: Magic Kingdom </h2>
        <p>I was so happy and fascinated, i wanted to arrive all the roller coasters, the one's that I remember was space mountain, peter pan flight, the flying dumbos. IT WAS INCREDIBLE, I WANT TO GO AGAIN.</p>
        <p>I remember I was watching the fireworks show over Cinderella's Castle. It truly felt like a dream come true.</p>
